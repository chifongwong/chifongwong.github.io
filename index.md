Hello! I am Freeman Wong, a theoretical physicist, currently an assistant professor in the Faculty of Data Science at City University of Macau.

I primarily work on particle physics phenomenology, focusing on neutrinos (about the origin of masses and mixings) and dark matter (about its nature and cosmological impact). I have also dedicated some time before to simulations and analysis of the Martian atmosphere, specifically its seasonal dust storms. Recently, I have been paying more attention to interdisciplinary topics among physics, data science, and finance.
